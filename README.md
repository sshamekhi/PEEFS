Abstract
This document describes Persian Emotion Elicitation Film Set. According to the authors’ knowledge, Persian Emotion Elicitation Film Set (PEEFS) is the first emotion elicitation Persian film set that has been collected and validated by an 88-person population using an online server-based website created in this work. We have watched 84 most-watched Iranian films to trim emotional segments, and the final set consists of 21 film clips, duration from 20 to 100 s, with discrete labeling based on six basic emotions and ratings in two dimensions of arousal and valence. These 21 film clips have the highest intensity at each target emotion. In addition, emotion scores of the film clips are also included. This database can be used to stimulate emotions and to design automatic emotion recognition systems at different levels. 
Description
the list of source films, description of the selected film clips, duration in seconds (L), and the selected discrete (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, surprise, and sadness) and dimensional (arousal and valence) emotion labels is available in Table 1.
